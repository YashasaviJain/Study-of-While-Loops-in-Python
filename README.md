# *Aim*

* To study the concept of While Loop in Python.
* To implement different programs using while loop.
* To understand looping using practical examples.

---

# *Theory*

* A while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is True.
* The condition is checked before every iteration.
* If the condition becomes False, the loop stops.
* It is useful when the number of iterations is not fixed.

### *Syntax*

while condition:
    statements

# *Algorithm*

## 1. Print Numbers from 1 to 6
* Step 1: Initialize i = 1
* Step 2: Check condition i <= 6
* Step 3: Print i
* Step 4: Increment i by 1
* Step 5: Repeat until condition becomes False

## 2. Print Numbers from 1 to N
* Step 1: Take input N
* Step 2: Initialize i = 1
* Step 3: Run loop while i <= N
* Step 4: Print i
* Step 5: Increment i

## 3. Factorial of a Number
* Step 1: Take input number
* Step 2: Initialize fact = 1
* Step 3: Multiply fact with number
* Step 4: Decrease number by 1
* Step 5: Repeat until number becomes 0
* Step 6: Print factorial

## 4. Fibonacci Series
* Step 1: Take number of terms
* Step 2: Initialize a = 0, b = 1
* Step 3: Print a
* Step 4: Calculate next term c = a + b
* Step 5: Update values
* Step 6: Repeat

## 5. Reverse a Number
* Step 1: Take input number
* Step 2: Initialize rev = 0
* Step 3: Extract last digit using % 10
* Step 4: Add digit to reversed number
* Step 5: Remove last digit using // 10
* Step 6: Repeat until number becomes 0

## 6. Check Palindrome
* Step 1: Take input number/string
* Step 2: Reverse the input
* Step 3: Compare original and reversed value
* Step 4: If same → Palindrome
* Step 5: Else → Not Palindrome

## 7. Count Digits
* Step 1: Take input number
* Step 2: Initialize counter = 0
* Step 3: Divide number by 10
* Step 4: Increase counter
* Step 5: Print total count

## 8. Search Element in List
* Step 1: Create list
* Step 2: Take element to search
* Step 3: Traverse list using while loop
* Step 4: If element found → Print index
* Step 5: Else → Print not found

## 9. Print Odd Numbers (1 to 10)
* Step 1: Initialize i = 0
* Step 2: Run loop till 10
* Step 3: Skip even numbers using continue
* Step 4: Print odd numbers

---

# *Conclusion*

* Studied the concept of while loop.
* Learned condition-based repetition.
* Implemented programs like factorial, fibonacci, palindrome, searching, and counting digits.
* While loop is useful when number of iterations depends on a condition.
